# DDNS

*Decentralised Domain Name System*

---

In Q4 2021, metaverse will attempt to register the namespace `.ddns` on BNS. This will be the beginning of building a decentralised and censorship-resistant Web 3.0 on Bitcoin. 

Domains registered on DDNS are globally unique, strongly owned, human-readable and hijack-resistant.

To access a DDNS site, you'll initially need to either change your current DNS servers to ones that support DDNS or install the browser extension. We recommend changing your DNS settings. We'll host a number of these servers, but the code is open-source and anyone can run one. You can run one on your local network for people using it, or open it up for everyone to use.

DDNS sites don't have a TLD alike Web2.0 domains (eg. instead of https://apple.com/, you'd visit https://apple). This is what distinguishes DDNS names from Web2.0 domains.

Names aren't registered to a single database (like ICANN) and anyone can create one. Funds generated from the registration fees will directly support metaverse, and make it harder for massdomain registrations.
