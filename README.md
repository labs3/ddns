# DDNS

*Decentralised Domain Name System*

---

In Q4 2021, metaverse will attempt to register the namespace `.ddns` on BNS. This will be the beginning of building a decentralised and censorship-resistant Web 3.0 on Bitcoin. 

Names built on DDNS are globally unique, strongly owned, human-readable and hijack-resistant.
